# Duels

Duels is a game mode where the player can quickly play a match for a fixed reward.
 
The goal of duels is to provide instant results to the player. A player can play a duel any number of times, currently, the SDK does not enforce a limit.
 
Unlike tournaments, Duels donâ€™t have start dates or end dates and are persistent.

## Demo

The video below shows the a quick play though for Duels, which include browsing the available events, selecting an event, playing a game and the Matchmaking and Results screen. (The video does not have any audio)
