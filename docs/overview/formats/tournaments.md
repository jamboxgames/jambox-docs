# Tournaments
 
A tournament is a competition between a set of players where the winners are rewarded with in-game items or currency. Both the entry fee and the rewards are defined by the developer.
 
When a player joins a tournament, they are given a certain number of attempts to submit their best score. When the tournament competes, based on the scoring rules a set of players is declared as winners.
 
Technically, a tournament is a time-bound restricted leaderboard. Each tournament will have multiple leaderboards governed by the size of the bracket and the total number of players participating.
 
Each Tournament has a Reward Group which defines the rewards (in-game items or currency) for a ranked group of players, which is awarded to the top bracket of the leaderboard.
