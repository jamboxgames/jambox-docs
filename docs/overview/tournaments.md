# Tournaments

A tournament is a competition between a set of players where the winners get an in-game item or currency. 

Entry for each tournament is either free or requires in-game currency

It allows the players to play a certain number of games to submit scores for each game. 

When the tournament competes, based on the scoring rules a set of players is declared as winners.

Technically, a tournament is a time-bound restricted leaderboard. Each tournament will have multiple leaderboards governed by the size of the bracket and the total number of players participating.

Each Tournament has a reward (in-game items or currency) which is awarded to the top bracket of the leaderboard.
