# Tournaments

A tournament is a competition between a set of players where the winners are rewarded with in-game items or currency. Both the entry fee and the rewards are defined by the developer.

When a player joins a tournment, they are given a certain number of attempts to subit thier best score. When the tournament competes, based on the scoring rules a set of players is declared as winners.

Technically, a tournament is a time-bound restricted leaderboard. Each tournament will have multiple leaderboards governed by the size of the bracket and the total number of players participating.

Each Tournament has a reward group which defines the rewards (in-game items or currency) for a ranked group of playes, which is awarded to the top bracket of the leaderboard.
