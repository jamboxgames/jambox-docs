# Introduction - Arena SDK

The Jambox Arena SDK helps game developers convert their single player games into Competitive multiplayer games. 
The SDK allows you to run competitive formats like Tournaments, Duels and Friendly Tournaments where the infrastructure and core services like match making is completely managed for you. 
As players spend more time in the game competing with other players you will see a lift in engagement and revenue metrics.

Arena SDK provides 3 competitive formats, each with their own benefits. 

### 1. Tournaments
Tournaments allow your player to complete with other players to either win in game currency or in game items. You can define the entry fee and currency for each tournaments. Thus you can have tournaments where:

The second scenario allows you to increase the spends on the usage of hard currency, which the users will need to top up with IAPs, thus increasing revenue generation in the game.
