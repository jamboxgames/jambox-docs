# Introduction - Arena SDK
 
The Jambox Arena SDK helps game developers convert their single-player games into Competitive multiplayer games.
The SDK allows you to run competitive formats like Tournaments, Duels, and Friendly Tournaments where the infrastructure and core services like match-making are completely managed for you.
As players spend more time in the game competing with other players you will see a lift in engagement and revenue metrics.
## The competitive Formats
Arena SDK provides 3 competitive formats, each with its benefits.

Tournaments allow your player to compete with other players to either win in game currency or in-game items. You can define the entry fee and currency for each tournament. Thus you can have tournaments where:
1. Users play for free to win soft currency like coins
2. Users spend soft or hard currency like coins or gems to win in-game items like Loot boxes, weapons, or skins.
The second scenario allows you to increase the spending on the usage of hard currency, which the users will need to top up with IAPs, thus increasing revenue generation in the game.
