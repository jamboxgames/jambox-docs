# Duels

Duels is a game mode where the player can quickly play a match for a fixed reward. 

The goal of duels is to provide instant results to the player. A player can play a duel any number of times, currently the SDK does not enforce a limit.

Unlike tournaments, Duels donâ€™t have start dates or end dates and are persistant.
